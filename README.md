Tiny AMA (ask me anything) website built with Django.

## Features

* Complete anonymous questions
    - optional user accounts for those who want
* All AMAs are unlisted (can only be accessed via a URL)
    - set expiry date for an AMA
    - after an AMA is over:
        - archive it (disable voting/editing)
        - make it public
* Threaded comments (just like reddit)
    - Only upvotes, no downvotes
    - sorted by vote count

## Purpose

* Self hosted easy way to conduct honest/anon AMAs within a
  company/startup.

## Anti-purpose

* Don't care about webscale
